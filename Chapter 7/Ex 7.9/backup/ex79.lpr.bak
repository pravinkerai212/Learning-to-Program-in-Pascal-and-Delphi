{
A Latin Square of order n is an n * n array which contains the numbers 1, 2, 3,..., n
such that each row and column contain each number exactly once. For example the
following diagram shows a Latin Square of order 4. You can see that each row can be
obtained from the previous one by shifting the elements one place to the left.

         1   2   3   4
         2   3   4   1
         3   4   1   2
         4   1   2   3

Design and write a program to store such a Latin Square of a size given by the user.
The program should also display the Latin Square.
