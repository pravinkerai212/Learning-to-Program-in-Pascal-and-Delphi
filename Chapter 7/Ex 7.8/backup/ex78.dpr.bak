{
Store in a 1-D array a set of 5 place names, and in a 2-D array the distances between the places.

Ensure that the order of the places is the same in both arrays. When the names of 2 places are input,
the distance between them is displayed.

If they are not both in the table, a suitable message should be displayed.
