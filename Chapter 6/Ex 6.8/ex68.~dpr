program ex68;
{
Write a program that asks the user for a word, and then displays the ASCII code for
each letter in the word.

Hint: Process one character at a time, using Read rather than Readln. As the user
types characters at the keyboard, the characters are stored in a buffer. When the
user presses the Enter key, the buffer is made available to the Read / Readln procedure.

Read will take individual characters from the buffer as required but leave the end-of-line
character produced by the Enter key, in the buffer. You can use EoLn to check for the
end-of-line character. To clear the input buffer use Readln.
